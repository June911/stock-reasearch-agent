# INVESTIGATION #2: CRM PLATFORM MIGRATION - SALESFORCE TO VAULT

## OFFICIAL STORY

Veeva announced in 2023 its plan to migrate all customers from legacy Salesforce-based Veeva CRM to proprietary Vault CRM platform. New customers have been placed on Vault CRM since early 2024. Migration of existing customers began in early 2025, with completion targeted for 2030. This represents a strategic pivot from relying on Salesforce infrastructure to building independent, Veeva-controlled CRM capabilities.

(Source: Veeva official announcement 2024)

**Competitive Context** [MEDIUM confidence]
- Salesforce-IQVIA partnership: Explicitly competing for Veeva customers
- Life sciences CRM market: Fragmented between Veeva, Salesforce, and specialized vendors
- Customer options: Vault CRM (new), Salesforce CRM (legacy), Salesforce-IQVIA partnership (alternative)
- Migration risk: Some customers may choose to switch to Salesforce-IQVIA instead of migrating to Vault

## ANALYSIS: WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING

**1. Strategic Rationale - Why Veeva Left Salesforce**

The migration was driven by THREE strategic imperatives:

**a) Control & Independence**
- Veeva was paying substantial fees to Salesforce for CRM hosting/licensing
- Each new feature required Salesforce platform capabilities or approval
- Salesforce had leverage to increase pricing or restrict Veeva's direction
- By 2023, Veeva had enough scale ($2.1B+ revenue) to build its own CRM
- Vault platform already existed for content management; extending to CRM was natural evolution

**b) Product Differentiation & Speed**
- Vault CRM can be optimized specifically for life sciences workflows
- Veeva can move faster than waiting for Salesforce to add features
- Pharmaceutical-specific functionality (compliance, field force optimization) can be prioritized
- Competitive response to Salesforce-IQVIA partnership alliance
- Control over roadmap and pricing without third-party constraints

**c) Margin Expansion**
- Reducing Salesforce license/hosting fees directly improves margins
- Building on Veeva's own platform is lower cost than paying platform rent
- Vertical CRM can command premium pricing by being life-sciences optimized
- Long-term margin accretion as technical debt is paid down

**2. Migration Risk Assessment - Is This Dangerous?**

**Customer Defection Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Risk Factors:
- **Switching costs**: Moving from Salesforce ecosystem to proprietary platform creates inertia
- **Lost third-party integrations**: Salesforce CRM ecosystem is mature; Vault CRM may have gaps initially
- **Employee training**: Salesforce skills are transferable; Vault CRM requires new training
- **Proven vs. unproven**: Salesforce CRM is mature; Vault CRM is new (launched April 2024, unproven at scale)
- **Timeline pressure**: Customers must migrate by ~2030 or be forced off (artificial deadline)

**Evidence of Concern**:
- Professional services margin declined from 22% to 18% (could indicate customer migration resistance)
- "Some customers choosing Salesforce-IQVIA partnership" mentioned in 10-K risk factors
- Veeva NOT renewing Salesforce agreement (forcing migration; not optional)
- Specific customer loss names/numbers NOT disclosed in SEC filings (suggests limited losses so far, but unknown)

**Why Migration Might Succeed**:
- Veeva has deep life sciences expertise; custom CRM could be superior
- Existing Veeva Vault customers already know platform (content + CRM reduces learning curve)
- Same data model maintained (technical friction minimized)
- Veeva controlling customer's digital infrastructure increases stickiness/switching costs
- No viable alternative for pure-play life sciences CRM (Salesforce-IQVIA requires IQVIA partnership)

---

**3. The Margin Decline Mystery**

Professional services margins dropped 22% → 18% (Q3 FY2026). THREE possible explanations:

**Hypothesis A: Migration Disruption** (Most likely)
- Customers reducing implementation spending during transition period
- Veeva absorbing migration costs (service cost increase; lower margin)
- Some customers seeking external implementation partners instead of Veeva services
- Temporary effect; should recover post-2027 as migrations complete

**Hypothesis B: Pricing Pressure**
- Customers negotiating lower service rates during migration period
- Salesforce ecosystem has mature pricing; Vault CRM service pricing may be competitive
- IQVIA partnership offering more attractive pricing bundle
- More structural concern; could persist

**Hypothesis C: Service Delivery Challenges**
- Vault CRM migration is operationally complex (new platform issues, bugs, delays)
- Veeva delivering more service hours per customer to resolve migration issues
- Service cost inflation exceeding customer willingness to pay for implementation
- Staffing challenges or delivery inefficiencies during platform transition

**Which Is Real?**: Most likely Hypothesis A (temporary disruption) + some Hypothesis B (pricing), with Hypothesis C being minor. Margin should recover in 2028-2030 if migrations complete successfully.

**4. Hidden Competitive Dynamics**

**IQVIA Partnership Threat Assessment**:
- Salesforce + IQVIA partnership is targeting Veeva's life sciences dominance
- IQVIA brings regulatory/clinical data advantages
- Salesforce brings CRM platform maturity and ecosystem
- Customers now have clear alternative to Vault CRM
- This partnership likely motivated Veeva to accelerate own CRM (competitive response)

**Veeva's Counter-Strategy**:
- Vault CRM differentiation: Life sciences-specific (IQVIA less focused on pure CRM)
- Existing customer lock-in: Deep Vault adoption makes switching harder
- Partnership opportunity: Veeva-IQVIA litigation settlement (Aug 2025) now enables potential partnership (mitigates competitive threat)
- First-mover advantage in pure-play life sciences CRM

## MANAGEMENT SIGNAL: ⚠️ NEUTRAL-TO-GOOD (Strategic Risk, Well-Executed)

**Positive Signals**:
1. **Bold Strategic Move**: Gassner willing to make fundamental platform shift shows strategic confidence
2. **Operational Excellence**: Launch on schedule (April 2024), migrations proceeding (early 2025)
3. **Customer Comfort**: Same data model + same UI reduces friction; shows thoughtful execution
4. **Margin Motivation**: Cost discipline evident (seeking to eliminate Salesforce fees)
5. **IQVIA Settlement Timing**: Resolved competitor conflict (Aug 2025) before peak migration period (2026-2029)

**Risk Signals**:
1. **Margin Compression**: 4-point decline in professional services margins is material
2. **Timing Pressure**: Forcing migration by 2030 (not giving customers escape hatch)
3. **Execution Risk**: New platform always has early adoption risks
4. **Competitive Vulnerability**: Window during migration (2025-2030) where customers might defect to IQVIA
5. **Silent Customer Losses**: No specific disclosure of customer defection; suggests some ongoing but amount unknown

**Overall Management Assessment**: Strategic execution appears sound, but execution risk is real. Margins declining signals some customer friction. Success depends on:
- Migration staying on schedule (2026-2029)
- Vault CRM proving competitive vs. Salesforce
- Minimal customer defections to IQVIA partnership
- Professional services margins recovering post-2027

## INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS

**For Bull Case**:
- Margin expansion opportunity (eliminates Salesforce fees)
- Customer stickiness increase (proprietary platform = harder switching)
- Competitive moat (life sciences-specific CRM)
- Well-planned, on-schedule execution

**For Bear Case**:
- Near-term margin pressure (migrations are disruptive)
- Customer defection risk (some choosing IQVIA partnership)
- Execution risk (new platform at scale always risky)
- Timing risk (forced 2030 deadline creates customer urgency to exit)

**Base Case**: Veeva successfully executes migration with ~3-5% customer attrition over 2025-2030. Margin recovers to 20%+ by 2031. Competitive position strengthened by proprietary CRM.

---

**Investigation Complete**: CRM migration is STRATEGIC CHOICE, not panic response. Higher risk but potentially significant upside.

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Timeline and strategy confirmed via official sources; customer impact estimated but specific numbers not disclosed.

**Management Assessment**: Cautiously positive - bold strategic vision, good operational execution, but real execution risk during migration window (2025-2030).

**Key Metric to Monitor**: Professional services margin recovery (watch 10-Q for stabilization in 2028-2029).

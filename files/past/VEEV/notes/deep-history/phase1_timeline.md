## MAJOR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES & RED FLAGS

### 1. CRM PLATFORM MIGRATION (2024-2030) ⚠️ [MEDIUM]
- **Initiative**: Migrating from Salesforce-based CRM to proprietary Veeva Vault CRM
- **Timeline**: Begin migration, target completion by ~2030
- **Status**: Some large customers already switching to Salesforce-IQVIA partnership as alternative
- **Risk**: Customer defection to competitor CRM solution
- **Evidence**: 10-K Item 1A risk factors mention "CRM platform migration"
- **Verification needed**: Specific customer losses, timeline details, migration cost
(Source: 10-K FY2025 Item 1A Risks)

### 2. LITIGATION & TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION ⚠️ [MEDIUM]
- **Case**: Trade secret misappropriation lawsuit pending
- **Settlement charges (9 months FY2026)**: $30.6M
- **Prior year (9 months)**: ~$5M in charges (6x increase YoY)
- **Risk disclosed**: Potential for "significant damages" if case lost
- **Status**: Ongoing as of Q3 FY2026
- **Verification needed**: Case name, defendants, specific allegations, probability assessment
(Source: 10-Q Q3 FY2026 Item 1A Risks; SEC filings)

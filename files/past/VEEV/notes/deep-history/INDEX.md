## ⚠️ Key Risks & Opportunities

### Risks (Bear Case)
- CRM migration execution (new platform, customer defection)
- Customer concentration (top 10 = 28% of revenue)
- Industry concentration (100% life sciences)
- Competitive threat (Salesforce-IQVIA partnership)
- Management succession (no clear plan disclosed)

### Opportunities (Bull Case)

- Customer stickiness increase (proprietary platform lock-in)

- Life sciences growth tailwind (pharma/biotech spending)

### Base Case
- CRM migration: 3-5% customer attrition, on schedule through 2030
- Margins: Recovery to 32-33% by 2027 (from current ~31%)
- Growth: 12-15% annual (from current 16%)
- Valuation: 8-10x EV/S (from current ~11x)

## Founding Story

Tesla Motors was incorporated on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who recognized an emerging market opportunity: affluent, environmentally-motivated buyers seeking a high-performance electric vehicle rather than compromising between efficiency (Prius) and performance. Eberhard served as CEO and Tarpenning as CFO. In February 2004, Elon Musk led a $7.5 million Series A funding round (contributing $6.35 million personally) and became Tesla's chairman and largest shareholder. Musk took an increasingly active role, becoming CEO in October 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement allowed five individuals—Eberhard, Tarpenning, Musk, Straubel, and Wright—to legally claim co-founder status.

## Product Evolution

Tesla's product strategy progressed systematically from premium sports cars to mass-market vehicles and energy storage. The Tesla Roadster launched in 2008 (first deliveries February 2008), establishing Tesla as a legitimate electric vehicle manufacturer through 2012. The Model S sedan debuted in June 2012, shifting focus to luxury sedans and achieving significant profitability. The Model X premium crossover followed in Fall 2015 after design delays on its signature Falcon Wing doors. The pivotal Model 3 launched July 28, 2017, targeting mass-market buyers with ~30 deliveries on launch day—this vehicle became Tesla's volume driver and primary profit engine. The Model Y crossover emerged in March 2020, rounding out the vehicle lineup. Beyond vehicles, Tesla diversified into energy storage with the Powerwall (announced April 2015, initial production began in January 2016) for residential use and the Powerpack for commercial/grid applications (prototype deployments starting 2012, mass production by early 2017). The acquisition of SolarCity in November 2016 for $2.6 billion expanded Tesla into integrated solar-plus-storage solutions.

## Key Milestones

- **IPO (June 29, 2010):** Tesla went public on NASDAQ at $17/share, with stock surging 40.5% on Day 1 to close at $23.89. Market cap at IPO: approximately $1.7 billion.
- **SolarCity Acquisition (November 21, 2016):** $2.6 billion all-stock transaction to establish Tesla Energy business; included commitment to build large-scale solar manufacturing in Buffalo, New York (Gigafactory New York).
- **Panasonic Partnership (July 2014):** Signed agreement to co-develop Gigafactory Nevada, a massive battery manufacturing complex with Panasonic as principal lithium-ion cell supplier. Facility achieved 37 GWh annual capacity by 2021.
- **Stock Splits:** August 31, 2020 (5-for-1 split, reducing price from ~$2,213 to ~$442); August 25, 2022 (3-for-1 split, reducing price from ~$891 to ~$297). Combined effect: one pre-2020 share became 15 shares.
- **S&P 500 Entry (December 21, 2020):** Tesla entered the S&P 500 with a market cap of $608 billion, the largest company ever added to the index and the sixth-largest US company by market capitalization at that time.

## Stock Performance Context

Tesla's stock has dramatically outperformed the broader market. A $10,000 investment at the June 2010 IPO price would have grown to approximately $3 million (as of early 2024), vastly exceeding comparable S&P 500 returns (~$57,000 on the same $10,000 investment). Tesla has been the top-performing S&P 500 stock over the past decade. The two stock splits (2020 and 2022) were implemented to reduce share price and improve retail accessibility. Market capitalization expanded from $1.7 billion at IPO (2010) to $608 billion upon S&P 500 entry (December 2020), reflecting explosive growth driven by Model 3 profitability, energy storage expansion, and industry leadership in electric vehicles.

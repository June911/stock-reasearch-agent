## Founding Story

NVIDIA was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (former director at LSI Logic and AMD microprocessor designer), Chris Malachowsky (Sun Microsystems engineer), and Curtis Priem in Fremont, California. The three founders began working from Priem's townhouse with just $600 in combined personal capital, aiming to solve 3D graphics for PCs. Initially called "NVision," they renamed to NVIDIA after learning the original name was taken by a toilet paper manufacturer. Despite having no prior entrepreneurial experience, the founders selected the 30-year-old Huang as CEO on day one, positioning NVIDIA to address the emerging demand for dedicated graphics processing.

## Product Evolution

NVIDIA's product evolution reflects three strategic eras. The first era (1995-1999) saw the company release its NV1 graphics card in 1995 and achieve breakthrough success with the Riva in 1997 (selling one million units in four months), followed by the GeForce 256 in late 1999—marketed as the world's first GPU with hardware Transform and Lighting processing. The second era (2000-2016) saw continuous GPU architecture evolution through GeForce (GeForce3, GeForce FX, GeForce7 series), introduction of CUDA programming model (2006) enabling general-purpose GPU computing, and expansion into data centers with Tesla GPU line (2007 onwards: Tesla K80, P100, V100). The third AI-acceleration era (2016-present) drives growth through purpose-built architectures: Pascal, Volta, Ampere (2020), and Hopper architectures, culminating in H100 GPUs (2022) with 80 billion transistors and dedicated Transformer Engines for LLMs. By 2025, data center and AI chips now represent the dominant revenue driver (70%+ of revenue), with consumer gaming and professional visualization as secondary markets.

## Key Milestones

- **January 22, 1999:** IPO at $12 per share, raising $40 million, valuing the company at ~$625 million
- **2006:** Introduction of Tesla microarchitecture as first GPU fully supporting DirectX 10; establishment of CUDA ecosystem democratizing GPU computing
- **2007:** Launch of Tesla GPU brand for data centers, pioneering GPU-accelerated computing for research and HPC
- **April 27, 2020:** Completion of $6.9 billion Mellanox Technologies acquisition, integrating high-speed networking with GPU compute to drive data center infrastructure sales to $70B+ run rate
- **February 8, 2022:** Termination of attempted $40 billion acquisition of ARM Holdings due to regulatory challenges from FTC, UK, and EU authorities
- **March 22, 2022:** Introduction of H100 GPU with Transformer Engine, enabling 30x faster AI inference vs. predecessor A100; rapidly became the dominant chip for LLM training by major AI labs (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic)
- **2023-2025:** Market cap expansion from $1 trillion to $4.6+ trillion; stock splits and share buybacks; establishment as world's most valuable company

## Stock Performance Context

NVIDIA's stock has delivered exceptional returns: from IPO at $12 in January 1999 through January 2025, the stock appreciated 351,244% (or 805,582% from original market cap of $562.8M to $4.53T), representing a 39.83% compound annual growth rate. The company underwent four stock splits (three 2-for-1, one 3-for-2) between 1999-2020. Recent acceleration is dramatic: the 10-year CAGR (2015-2025) is 75.01%, driven by AI demand. Recent milestones show Q2 2026 (ended July 27, 2025) revenue of $90.8 billion with gross margins of 66.7% and operating income of $50.1 billion, demonstrating unprecedented scale and profitability. The all-time high stock price was $207.04 in October 2025, with current market cap of $4.637 trillion making NVIDIA the world's most valuable public company.

**Ticker:** VEEV
**Research Date:** November 18, 2025
**Researcher:** History Specialist

## Founding Story

Veeva Systems was founded in 2007 by Peter Gassner, Matt Wallach, Doug Ostler, and Mitch Wallace in California. Gassner, with a background as a software developer who had served as Chief Architect and General Manager at PeopleSoft and Senior Vice President of Technology at Salesforce, recognized a critical gap in the market: pharmaceutical and biotech companies needed specialized cloud-based software workflows for regulatory publishing, clinical trial management, and customer relationship management that generic CRM systems could not support. The company's founding belief was to build a purpose-built cloud software suite on Salesforce's platform specifically for life sciences companies, addressing their unique compliance and operational needs.

## Product Evolution

Veeva launched its initial product, Veeva CRM, in 2008 on the Salesforce cloud platform, enabling pharmaceutical sales representatives to access HCP (healthcare provider) and prescription data within a compliant, multi-channel interface. The major inflection point came in February 2011 when Veeva introduced Vault, described as "the first cloud-based, regulated content management system built specifically for the life sciences industry." By September 2012, Veeva expanded Vault into the enterprise market with a comprehensive suite of content management applications tailored to the global life sciences industry. In May 2023, Veeva unveiled Vault CRM, a next-generation CRM platform built on its proprietary Vault architecture (not Salesforce), featuring innovative applications including CRM Bot and Service Center. This 2022-2023 transition from Salesforce dependency to proprietary Vault platform represented a significant strategic shift, with the company planning to cease its Salesforce partnership by September 2025 (with a wind-down period until 2030). Current Vault CRM adoption includes 30+ companies, with major pharmaceutical companies planning to migrate thousands of users to the new platform by end of 2025.

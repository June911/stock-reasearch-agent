---

## Investigation Queue (Ranked by Priority & Impact)

### PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL STRATEGIC DECISIONS

#### 1.1 Salesforce Separation: End of 15-Year Partnership [HIGHEST PRIORITY]

**Official Story**:
- December 2022: "Moving to Vault platform for better customer experience"
- Financial angle: "Potential cost savings via single vendor (AWS) consolidation"

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **Timing Question**: Why December 2022? What triggered this timing specifically?
- ⚠️ **Long Partnership Reversal**: Built entire $10B+ business on Salesforce (2008-2022), now abandoning it
- ⚠️ **Vague Benefits**: "Better customer experience" is marketing speak - what's the real driver?
- ⚠️ **5-Year Wind-Down**: 2025-2030 migration window is unusually long for a strategic shift
- ⚠️ **Competitive Pressure**: Did Salesforce threaten Veeva's business model or margins?

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **Timeline Context**:
   - What happened in Q3/Q4 2022? Competitive threats? Market shifts?
   - Did any customers switch or threaten to?
   - What was Salesforce's pricing/licensing strategy change at that time?

2. **Documents to Find**:
   - 10-K (2024 filing for FY2024) - MD&A section on Vault platform strategy
   - 10-Q quarters 2023-2024 - Any revenue recognition changes with Salesforce?
   - Earnings call transcripts (Q3 2022) - What was management saying then?
   - Press releases pre-December 2022 - Any hints?

3. **Financial Evidence**:
   - Veeva CRM profitability vs. Vault CRM profitability
   - Licensing costs to Salesforce (% of revenue) - did these increase?
   - Vault CRM revenue trajectory since GA (April 2024) - is migration accelerating?

4. **Management Quality Signal to Assess**:
   - Is this patient capital execution (planned long ago) OR reactive (threat response)?
   - Did they communicate honestly about the reasons?
   - How's the migration going (stuck or smooth)?

**Investment Implication**: If reactive/defensive, suggests market competitiveness issue. If planned/strategic, shows vision. Critical difference.

#### 1.2 Crossix $430M Acquisition: Was This Strategic or Panic? [HIGH PRIORITY]

**Official Story**:
- September 2019 announcement: "Complementary fit - HCP data + patient data"
- "Pair doctor and patient data for better marketing effectiveness measurement"

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **$430M is Huge**: This is ~2+ years of operating profit at that time. Why so expensive?
- ⚠️ **Timing**: November 2019 close - right before COVID-19 disrupted pharma. Coincidence?
- ⚠️ **Independent Unit Structure**: Crossix stayed independent as "Veeva Crossix" - why? (Integration failure hiding?)
- ⚠️ **Revenue Contribution Unknown**: What % of Veeva revenue comes from Crossix today?
- ⚠️ **IQVIA Competition**: Was this defensive (lose market share to IQVIA) or offensive (expand addressable market)?

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **Timeline Context** (2018-2019):
   - Was Veeva losing customers to IQVIA before this deal?
   - Did Veeva CRM have margin compression? Revenue growth slowdown?
   - What was IQVIA's competitive move that threatened Veeva?
   - Did any major customers demand better data capabilities?

2. **Documents to Find**:
   - 10-K (2020 filing for FY2020) - Acquisition rationale in MD&A, any Crossix guidance
   - 8-K filing (November 2019) - Official acquisition announcement and strategic rationale
   - 10-Q (2020 Q1/Q2) - First guidance on Crossix integration
   - Earnings call (Q1 2020 & beyond) - How did management talk about Crossix success?

3. **Financial Evidence**:
   - Crossix revenue contribution % (in segment reporting)
   - Crossix profitability - is it accretive or dilutive to Veeva?
   - Did Veeva miss any financial targets due to Crossix integration costs?
   - How many customers used both Veeva CRM + Crossix data by 2024?

4. **Management Quality Signal to Assess**:
   - Did they overpay? ($430M for private company is expensive)
   - Did integration work or is it still siloed as "independent unit"?
   - Are customers getting the promised benefits (HCP + patient combo)?
   - Is management learning from mistakes?

**Investment Implication**: Largest single capital deployment shows whether management executes M&A well or throws money at problems.

#### 1.3 Data Cloud Strategy vs. IQVIA: Playing Offense or Defense? [HIGH PRIORITY]

**Official Story**:
- April 2022: "Veeva Data Cloud - unified architecture for modern data analytics"
- "Compass products to modernize prescriber data for complex therapies"

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **IQVIA Target**: Data Cloud (Compass) clearly designed to take share from IQVIA
- ⚠️ **Timing**: 3 years after Crossix acquisition - took long time to productize that data
- ⚠️ **Competitive Reality**: IQVIA has 20+ year lead in data/analytics - can Veeva really compete?
- ⚠️ **Adoption Unknown**: Is Compass actually gaining traction or niche product?
- ⚠️ **Business Model Shift**: Moving from pure software (CRM/Vault) to data product business (different margins, stickiness)

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **Timeline Context** (2019-2022):
   - Did IQVIA lose share or did Veeva see opportunity for complementary product?
   - What was happening in data/analytics space in pharma 2019-2022?
   - Did any pharma companies demand data alternatives to IQVIA?
   - Was this Gassner's long-term vision or reactive to Crossix acquisition?

2. **Documents to Find**:
   - 10-K (2023, 2024, 2025 filings) - Segment reporting on Data Cloud vs. CRM revenue
   - Earnings calls (2022-2024) - Compass adoption metrics, customer wins
   - Product launches - Any competitor moves (IQVIA, Salesforce) in this space?
   - Customer wins (press releases) - Which pharma companies chose Compass?

3. **Financial Evidence**:
   - What % of revenue is Compass/data products today?
   - Gross margins on data products vs. software
   - Customer acquisition cost and LTV for Compass
   - Is it accretive to overall profitability?

4. **Management Quality Signal to Assess**:
   - Is this bold market expansion OR desperate Crossix rescue?
   - Are they being realistic about IQVIA competition?
   - Have they communicated Compass strategy clearly to investors?
   - Any write-downs or guidance misses on data products?

**Investment Implication**: Shows whether Veeva is expanding TAM (bullish) or defending existing business (cautious).

### PRIORITY 2: EXECUTION & CAPITAL ALLOCATION

#### 2.1 Vault CRM 5+ Year Development: Why So Long? [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

**Official Story**:
- May 2023: "Vault CRM - built on modern architecture"
- April 2024: GA with early adopters live

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **12+ Year Gap**: Vault platform launched 2011, Vault CRM announced May 2023 - why 12 years?
- ⚠️ **Architectural Reason Unclear**: If Vault could support CRM, why the long delay?
- ⚠️ **Slow Customer Migration**: Only "early adopter" in first year (GA April 2024) - adoption sluggish?
- ⚠️ **Feature Parity Claims**: Does Vault CRM really have feature parity with Salesforce-based version?
- ⚠️ **Competitive Threat**: Did Salesforce threaten to cut off Veeva or change licensing terms?

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **Technical/Product Timeline**:
   - When did engineering start Vault CRM work? (2017? 2020?)
   - What architectural challenges delayed release?
   - Did Vault platform need significant redesign for CRM?

2. **Financial Evidence**:
   - Vault CRM revenue contribution (% of total CRM revenue since GA)
   - Migration rate: How many customers switched from Salesforce version?
   - Customer churn on CRM during transition period?
   - Any revenue impact from delayed product launch?

3. **Management Quality Signal**:
   - Did they rush release or do thorough engineering?
   - Are customer wins increasing post-GA or stalling?
   - What's their realistic timeline for majority migration?

**Investment Implication**: Shows execution speed and prioritization. CRM is core business - 5-6 year delay on new platform could indicate organizational dysfunction.

#### 2.2 2015 "Triple Acquisition" Year: Which, How Much, What Success? [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

**Official Story**: None clear - only Tracxn reports "3 acquisitions in 2015"

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **Acquisitions Unknown**: Which 3 companies? For how much? Why no clear record?
- ⚠️ **Integration Success Unknown**: Did they succeed or become write-downs?
- ⚠️ **Acquisition Pattern**: Suggests either aggressive growth or distress buying

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **SEC Filing Review**:
   - 10-K (2016 filing for FY2015) - Will list all acquisitions
   - Look for 8-K filings from 2015
   - Check for goodwill impairments in later 10-Ks

2. **Financial Evidence**:
   - Deal values and consideration
   - Revenue contribution from acquired companies
   - Any goodwill write-downs post-2015

3. **Management Quality Signal**:
   - Were these strategic purchases or throw-ins?
   - Did integration work?

**Investment Implication**: Minor but shows pattern of capital allocation and M&A execution capability.

### PRIORITY 3: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & SIGNALS

#### 3.1 Public Benefit Corporation Conversion (Feb 2021): Why & What Changed? [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

**Official Story**:
- "Formalize values already in culture"
- "Multi-stakeholder accountability"
- "99% shareholder approval"

**Suspicious Patterns**:
- ⚠️ **Timing**: Why Feb 2021? What triggered this specific moment?
- ⚠️ **Shareholder Vote**: 99% approval - was this management-driven mandate or genuine shareholder desire?
- ⚠️ **Business Impact**: Did PBC status actually change any decisions? Or purely symbolic?
- ⚠️ **Employee/Customer Response**: Did this resonate or feel performative?

**What Phase 3 Should Investigate**:
1. **Timeline Context**:
   - What happened in late 2020 to prompt this?
   - Was it Peter Gassner's initiative?
   - Did employee or customer pressure drive this?

2. **Documents to Find**:
   - Proxy statement (2021) - PBC proposal details
   - Press release explaining conversion rationale
   - Any management commentary on why PBC, why now

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Did any corporate decisions change post-PBC status?
   - Example: Pricing changes, customer service changes, product strategy
   - Any shareholder criticism of PBC status?

4. **Management Quality Signal**:
   - Is this visionary leadership (multi-stakeholder focus) OR performative (PR move)?
   - Have they stayed true to PBC commitments?

**Investment Implication**: Shows management's philosophy and stakeholder orientation. Important for long-term trust.

## Cross-Investigation Themes to Watch For

### Pattern: Defensive vs. Offensive Moves
- **Crossix ($430M)** - Defensive (IQVIA threat) or offensive (market expansion)?
- **Data Cloud (Compass)** - Defensive (losing CRM margins) or offensive (new market)?
- **Salesforce Separation** - Defensive (vendor lock-in) or offensive (product vision)?

**Red Flag if Pattern is Mostly Defensive**: Company is reactive, not strategic. Management under pressure.
**Green Flag if Pattern is Mostly Offensive**: Clear vision, patient capital, strategic discipline.

### Pattern: Acquisition Integration
- How did 2015 acquisitions perform?
- How is Crossix performing (still independent unit after 5 years - why)?
- What's Veeva's M&A track record showing?

**Red Flag if Integrations Fail**: Management can't execute on acquisitions.
**Green Flag if Integrations Work**: Shows capability to buy talent/customers.

### Pattern: Product Development Speed
- 12 years to Vault CRM (slow)
- 3 years to productize Crossix data as Compass (medium)
- Rapid early CRM iterations 2008-2012 (fast)

**Red Flag if Product Development Slowed**: Organization losing focus or becoming bureaucratic.
**Green Flag if Deliberate**: Patient, quality-focused engineering.

### Pattern: Communication Transparency
- How clearly do they explain strategic pivots?
- Do they admit mistakes or double down on failures?
- Are financial impacts disclosed clearly?

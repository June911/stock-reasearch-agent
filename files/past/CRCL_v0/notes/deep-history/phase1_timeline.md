## STRATEGIC EXPANSION (2018-2019)

### 2018: Major Strategic Moves

- **Rationale (stated)**: Build Poloniex into marketplace for "tokens which represent everything of value," including physical goods, real estate, creative productions
- **Source**: (TechCrunch, CoinDesk, Nasdaq)
- **Confidence**: HIGH

⚠️ **Doubt Flag**: $400M acquisition during peak crypto hype - due diligence quality? Strategic fit assessment?

- **Purpose**: Joint venture to develop and govern USDC stablecoin
- **Source**: (Coinbase Blog, Circle Blog, CoinTelegraph)

- **Operational Impact**: US customers could no longer trade on Poloniex starting November 1, 2019
- **Source**: (Circle Blog, CoinDesk, Amy Castor Blog, SPAC documents 2021)
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM (need 10-K confirmation of $156.8M loss)

⚠️ **Doubt Flag - HIGH PRIORITY**: Why sell Poloniex at $156M loss after only 18 months? What changed between Feb 2018 vision and Oct 2019 reality? Crypto market downturn alone or strategic miscalculation? Management quality signal?

**Late 2019** - Sean Neville resigns as co-CEO
- **New Role**: Remains on board of directors
- **Result**: Jeremy Allaire becomes sole CEO
- **Source**: (Wikipedia, MarketsWiki)
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM

⚠️ **To Verify**: Exact date of Neville's resignation, stated reason, relationship to Poloniex divestiture

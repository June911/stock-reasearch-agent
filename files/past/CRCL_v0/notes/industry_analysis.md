**Date**: November 2025
**Focus**: What is this business? Why is it structured this way? What drives growth and change?

---

## 1. 这是什么生意？(WHAT IS THE BUSINESS?)

### 核心定义

**Circle Internet Group (CRCL)** operates as a financial infrastructure and stablecoin platform for blockchain-based payments and tokenized finance.

**Primary Revenue Engine**: Stablecoin issuance + Treasury yield capture
- Issues USDC (US Dollar Coin) and EURC (Euro Coin) - fiat-backed stablecoins
- Customers deposit fiat currency to mint stablecoins
- Circle invests customer deposits in safe, liquid assets (primarily US Treasury bills)
- Captures interest income from these reserves

**Secondary Growth Engines** (emerging): API-based infrastructure services, blockchain platform (Arc)

### 市场规模 & 增速

**Stablecoin Market Overall** (来源: Multiple analysts, 2024-2025)
- Global stablecoin market cap: $230-250 billion (Oct 2025)
- 2024-2025 growth rate: ~78% YoY (driven by USDC especially)
- Projected 2030 market: $1.6-3.5 trillion (Citigroup base case: $1.6T)

**Circle's Position** (来源: Circle earnings, Q2 2025)
- USDC circulation: $60.1 billion in circulation (Jan 2025, +78% YoY)
- EURC: $1+ billion, largest euro stablecoin
- 4.9 million meaningful USDC wallets
- Q2 2025 revenue: $658.1M (up 53% YoY from $430M)
- FY2024 revenue: $1.68 billion (up 15.6% YoY)

**Market Share in Stablecoins** (来源: CoinLaw, Oct 2025)
- USDC: 24.5-25.5% market share (2nd largest)
- USDT (Tether): 59.9-64% market share (dominant)
- Combined USDC + USDT: 84-89% of stablecoin market
- Growing: Other players (USDE, DAI, etc.) gaining traction

### 需求本质: 这解决什么问题?

**Problem 1: Cross-border Payment Friction**
- Traditional wire transfers: slow (1-3 days), expensive (2-5% fees), opaque
- USDC enables: instant settlement, <1% fees, full transparency on blockchain
- Use case validation: USDC remittance volume in Latin America +31% QoQ (2024-2025); #1 stablecoin for remittances in LA (World Bank 2025)

**Problem 2: Capital Efficiency for Institutions**
- Enterprises need fast settlement for global operations
- Traditional systems require float/reserves; USDC enables real-time clearing
- Use case: PayPal, MoneyGram (MoneyGram Wallet launched 2024 for peer-to-peer USDC remittances)

**Problem 3: Yield Capture for Idle Capital**
- Central banks, treasuries, institutional investors hold massive dollar reserves
- T-bills generate yield; stablecoins let retail/blockchain actors access this yield
- Example: USDC holders indirectly benefit from 4-5% T-bill yields embedded in stablecoin economics

**Problem 4: Censorship-Resistant, Programmable Money**
- Crypto traders need reliable dollar proxy that can't be frozen (unlike traditional bank accounts)
- Smart contract developers need transparent, programmable money
- Use case: $1 trillion monthly USDC transaction volume (Nov 2024)

**真需求 vs 伪需求 Assessment**:
- ✓ TRUE for payments/remittances: validated by actual transaction volume, regulatory approval, enterprise partnerships
- ✓ TRUE for institutional capital efficiency: validated by BlackRock managing USDC reserves, RWA tokenization growth
- ✓ TRUE for crypto ecosystem: validated by $60B+ USDC circulation, 4.9M wallets
- ? UNCERTAIN for mass consumer payments: still early, regulatory risk, payment app friction

## 2. 谁在赚钱? (WHO IS MAKING MONEY?)

### 竞争格局 & 市场份额

**Top Players**:

1. **Tether (USDT)**
   - Market share: 59.9-64%
   - USDT circulation: $146 billion (Feb 2025)
   - Revenue: Estimated $5+ billion annually (from Treasury yields on ~$120B reserves at 4-5% rates)
   - Status: Private company, less transparent

2. **Circle (USDC)**
   - Market share: 24.5-25.5%
   - USDC circulation: $60.1 billion (Jan 2025)
   - Revenue: $1.68B FY2024, $1.29B H1 2025 (Q1: $631M, Q2: $658M)
   - Status: Public (NYSE:CRCL since June 2025)

3. **Emerging Competitors**
   - **Aave's USDe**: Growing yieldcoin (stablecoin + yield-bearing)
   - **MakerDAO's DAI**: Decentralized stablecoin, 4-5% market share
   - **Liquid staking tokens** (Lido's LDO): Competing for yield capture role
   - **JPMorgan's JPMD**: Deposit token (launched June 2025), institutional focus

4. **Potential New Entrants**
   - Traditional banks (JPMorgan, Bank of America, UBS)
   - Tech giants (Apple, Google, Microsoft) - capital, distribution, trust
   - Central banks issuing CBDCs (e-Dollar, e-EUR)

### 价值链利润分配

**Where Is the Money?** - Stablecoin Economics Breakdown

```
Customer Deposits $100 in USDC
   ↓
Circle invests 95% in T-bills (~$95)
   ↓
T-bill yield ~4.5% annually = $4.27/year
   ↓
Circle Revenue: $4.27/year (99% of Circle's revenue)
   ├─ Payment processing/transaction fees: ~1% of revenue
   ├─ API/Infrastructure services: emerging, <1% currently
   └─ Other (MarketPlace, spreads): negligible

```

**毛利率结构** (来源: Circle financials, inferred)
- Treasury interest income: ~99% of revenue ($1.67B of $1.68B)
- Gross margin on interest income: ~95%+ (minimal direct costs)
- Operating expenses: ~$200-300M annually (ops, compliance, technology)
- Net margin (pre-tax): Highly negative currently (-$482M Q2 2025, but includes $591M non-cash IPO charges)

**As of latest data**: Circle is unprofitable on reported basis, but reserve interest business is structurally high-margin. Non-cash charges from IPO distort current profitability.

### 单位经济 (Unit Economics)

**Per Dollar of USDC Issued**:
- Annual yield to Circle: ~4.5% (current T-bill rate) = $0.045
- Operating cost per dollar: ~$0.005-0.01 (minimal transaction-based costs)
- Net economics: $0.035-0.040 per dollar annually (assuming no credit risk)

**Scalability**:
- Unit economics improve with scale: fixed compliance/infrastructure costs spread across larger USDC base
- Example: USDC base growing +78% YoY; if operating costs grow only 30-40% YoY, margin expansion is inevitable

## 3. 为什么是这个格局? (WHY THIS STRUCTURE?)

### 竞争优势来源

**Circle's Advantages**:

1. **Regulatory Compliance & Transparency** (HIGH MOAT)
   - First major stablecoin to get MiCA license (EU, 2024)
   - SEC registration as public company (2025 IPO)
   - Full reserve audits by Grant Thornton (public)
   - BlackRock manages USDC Reserve Fund - third-party institutional credibility
   - **Why it matters**: Tether faces MiCA compliance questions; EU delistings (Coinbase, Binance removed USDT Dec 2024)

2. **Scale & Network Effects** (MEDIUM-HIGH MOAT)
   - $60B USDC circulation = massive liquidity
   - 4.9M wallets using USDC
   - 500M+ end-user wallet integrations (Coinbase, MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)
   - Supported on 12+ blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, etc.)
   - High switching costs for exchanges/platforms that have already integrated

3. **Institutional Partnership & Trust** (MEDIUM MOAT)
   - BlackRock managing reserves (credibility signal)
   - Support from major exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com
   - Enterprise/fintech partnerships: PayPal's MoneyGram Wallet, Mastercard
   - DFSA (Dubai) official approval (Jan 2025)

4. **Technical Innovation** (MEDIUM MOAT)
   - Circle's "Arc" Layer-1 blockchain (announced 2024) for on-chain finance
   - API infrastructure: Web3 SDKs, programmable payments, treasury tools
   - Multi-chain strategy reduces platform risk

5. **Timing & Regulatory Favor** (HIGH MOAT, temporary)
   - US regulatory support: Crypto-friendly environment (Trump admin 2025)
   - "Circle is the compliant player" narrative benefits from Tether's scrutiny
   - GENIUS Act (July 2025) sets clear US framework that favors compliant players

### Tether's Advantages (Why Still #1):

1. **First-Mover Dominance** (VERY HIGH)
   - USDT issued since 2014 (10+ years of network effects)
   - Massive liquidity depth; preferred by Asian exchanges

2. **No Regulatory Drag** (during crypto bull cycles)
   - Private = no SEC disclosures, no compliance overhead
   - "Move fast" operational style appeals to crypto traders

3. **Capital Efficiency** (for current holders)
   - Estimated $120B in reserve assets → ~$5B annual interest income
   - Tether generates massive profits but reinvests/hoards

### 壁垒强度评估

**USDC Barriers**:
- **Regulatory license (MiCA, SEC)**: HARD to replicate (5+ year regulatory process)
- **Reserve management (BlackRock)**: MEDIUM (only differentiator if regulators require third-party custody)
- **Network effects**: MEDIUM (integrations sticky, but new chains emerging)
- **Compliance track record**: TIME-BASED (improves each year without incident)

**USDT Barriers**:
- **First-mover**: PERMANENT, but eroding
- **Exchange integration**: STICKY, but Coinbase/Crypto.com already delisting USDT in EU
- **Regulatory opacity**: TEMPORARY advantage, becoming liability

**New Entrant Barriers**:
- Getting regulatory approval: 3-5 years minimum
- Building exchange integration: 1-2 years
- Accumulating $60B+ in usage: requires either existing user base OR massive marketing
- **Verdict**: Very high barriers to entry; only exist for well-capitalized players (JPMorgan, Central Banks, major fintech)

### 这个格局是否稳定? (Is This Structure Stable?)

**Forces STRENGTHENING Circle's Position**:
1. ✓ Regulatory momentum (MiCA adoption, GENIUS Act in US)
2. ✓ Institutional adoption (BlackRock, RWA tokenization trend)
3. ✓ Enterprise partnerships (PayPal, Mastercard, MoneyGram)
4. ✓ Crypto market growth (USDC circulation +78% YoY)
5. ✓ API/infrastructure business emerging (higher margins than interest-only)

**Forces WEAKENING Circle's Position**:
1. ✗ Tether still has 2.4x market share; high switching costs for established users
2. ✗ Interest rate cuts (1% cut = -$441M annual revenue for Circle; T-bills at 4.5% in Nov 2025, potential 3-4% by 2026)
3. ✗ Regulatory overreach could limit stablecoin growth (US Congress risk)
4. ✗ Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could cannibalize stablecoin demand
5. ✗ JPMorgan's JPMD (deposit token) targets same institutional market with superior trust

**Verdict on Stability**:
- SHORT TERM (1-2 years): STABLE. Circle's position strengthening as #2 compliant player. Regulatory support tailwinds.
- MID TERM (3-5 years): SHIFTING. If CBDCs adopt widely, or if JPMorgan scales JPMD, market share distribution could change.
- LONG TERM (5-10 years): UNCERTAIN. Depends on whether stablecoins remain dominant form of on-chain money, or get displaced by CBDCs/deposit tokens.

## 4. 增长靠什么? (WHAT DRIVES GROWTH?)

### 需求侧 (Demand Side)

**Who Is Buying USDC?**

1. **Crypto Traders & Investors** (60-70% of usage)
   - Use USDC as "stable store of value" between trades
   - Move money between exchanges without going through banking system
   - Growth driver: Bull market in crypto → more trading → more USDC demand

2. **Remittance/Payment Users** (10-15% of usage, FASTEST GROWING)
   - Filipinos, Africans, Latin Americans sending money home
   - USDC remittance volume: +31% QoQ in Latin America (2024-2025)
   - Growth driver: MoneyGram Wallet, integration into regional payments apps

3. **Institutional/Corporate Users** (5-10%, EMERGING)
   - Multinationals settling supplier payments cross-border
   - Traders needing instant settlement
   - Growth driver: Regulatory approval, enterprise partnerships

4. **Blockchain Applications** (5-10%, STRUCTURAL)
   - DeFi protocols using USDC as reserve currency
   - Smart contracts denominating in USDC
   - Growth driver: DeFi ecosystem expansion, RWA tokenization

5. **Capital Allocators/Yield Seekers** (NEW & GROWING)
   - Institutional investors buying USDC yield products (yieldcoins)
   - Treasury managers parking funds in T-bill-backed stablecoins
   - Growth driver: Crypto adoption by traditional finance

### 供给侧 (Supply-Side Drivers)

**What's Enabling USDC Growth?**

1. **Regulatory Clarity** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - MiCA implementation (June 2024 → Dec 2024) = USDC eligible for EU institutional use
   - GENIUS Act (July 2025) = clear US framework
   - Result: USDC circulation grew 78% in 12 months post-MiCA

2. **Technology Infrastructure Maturity**
   - Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
   - Seamless on/off-ramps (MoneyGram, Coinbase, Crypto.com)
   - API SDKs making integration trivial
   - Result: Network effects compound; each new chain integration adds users

3. **Interest Rate Environment** (CRITICAL)
   - T-bill rates at 4.5% (Nov 2025) = very attractive yields for USDC reserves
   - Example: USDC Q1 2025 reserve income +55% YoY (driven by T-bill rates staying elevated)
   - Sensitivity: A 1% cut in rates = -$441M annual revenue for Circle
   - **Implication**: Circle's growth is partially dependent on interest rates staying high

4. **Institutional/Enterprise Adoption**
   - BlackRock managing reserves signals institutional-grade risk management
   - JPMorgan's JPMD is a COMPETITIVE THREAT but also validates market (big money coming to blockchain)
   - Corporate adoption: Stripe, Shopify potentially supporting USDC payments

### 增长公式 (Growth Formula)

```
USDC Circulation Growth = f(A, B, C, D, E)

Where:
A = New geographic markets entering USDC (remittances, emerging markets)
    Current: Latin America, Africa, SE Asia
    Potential: India, Middle East, Central Asia
    Weight: 30-40% of near-term growth

B = Depth of existing markets (increased transaction volume per user)
    Driver: DeFi adoption, RWA tokenization, institutional adoption
    Weight: 25-30% of growth

C = Interest rate environment (higher rates = higher yield = more reserve demand)
    Current: ~4.5% T-bill rates
    Sensitivity: -$441M annual revenue per 1% rate cut
    Weight: 20-25% of growth (affects profitability more than circulation)

D = Regulatory tailwinds (clarity enables adoption, reduces friction)
    Recent: MiCA (EU), GENIUS Act (US)
    Future: CBDC interop frameworks, UAE/Dubai approvals
    Weight: 15-20% of growth

E = Technology/Platform innovation (new use cases, lower friction)
    Arc blockchain, API improvements, smart contract features
    Weight: 10-15% of growth

Growth Rate = Baseline 40-50% (2025-2026) declining to 15-20% (2028-2030) as market matures
```

### 定量增长指标

**Near-term Growth Drivers (2025-2026)**:
- USDC circulation: $60B (Jan 2025) → projected $150-200B (end 2026)
- Remittance use case: $1-2T addressable market (World Bank); USDC <1% penetration
- Institutional RWA tokenization: $300B in on-chain RWAs (Sept 2025); majority USDC-denominated
- Enterprise API adoption: Emerging, early stage

**Medium-term (2027-2030)**:
- Stablecoin market: $1.6-3.5T (2030 projection)
- USDC share: IF maintains #2 position, could be $400-800B
- Profitability inflection: When operating leverage kicks in (likely 2026-2027)

## 5. 什么会改变一切? (KEY DISRUPTIVE FORCES)

### 技术演进 & 破坏性威胁

**CBDC Competition** (HIGH RISK)
- Central banks issuing digital currencies (e-Dollar, e-EUR, digital RMB)
- If CBDCs become primary settlement layer for finance:
  - Stablecoins become secondary/retail layer (still valuable, but lower upside)
  - Regulatory arbitrage advantage of USDC disappears
- **Timeline**: 2027-2030 for major CBDCs (Fed's digital dollar still in early stages)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (50%). CBDCs are progressing but facing implementation challenges.

**Deposit Token Competition** (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)
- JPMorgan's JPMD (live June 2025) offers:
  - Interest-bearing features (future)
  - Deposit insurance eligibility (potential)
  - Bank backing (stronger than crypto-native trust)
- If institutional money prefers bank-backed tokens:
  - Circle loses high-margin institutional revenue
  - But Circle's consumer/emerging market position less affected
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (40-50%). JPMorgan has capital/distribution to scale, but regulatory constraints exist.

**Layer-2 & Sidechain Proliferation** (MEDIUM RISK)
- New blockchains (Solana, Sui, Movement, etc.) reduce Ethereum/Polygon dominance
- If stablecoins fragment across chains (USDC-ETH vs USDC-Solana vs USD-Sui):
  - Liquidity fragmentation
  - Network effects weaken
- **Mitigation**: Circle's multi-chain strategy already addresses this
- **Probability**: LOW (20%). Circle is already multi-chain native.

### 周期性 & 宏观风险

**Interest Rate Sensitivity** (VERY HIGH RISK)
- Circle's model: 99% revenue from T-bill yields
- Current yield: 4.5%
- Fed rate cut scenario: Could drop to 3-4% by 2026
- Impact: -$441M annual revenue per 1% cut = 26% of current revenue at risk
- **Probability**: HIGH (70%). Fed has already signaled rate cuts for 2026.

**Economic Recession** (MEDIUM RISK)
- In recession, risk assets (crypto) tend to decline
- USDC demand likely plateaus (less trading, less DeFi activity)
- BUT: Remittance use case stabilizes or grows (counter-cyclical)
- **Historical precedent**: 2022-2023 crypto crash; USDC circulation stable/growing
- **Verdict**: Moderate downside risk in recession, but not existential

**Crypto Market Cycle** (MEDIUM RISK)
- If crypto enters "bear market" (next 2-3 years):
  - Trading volume drops → less USDC needed for crypto trading
  - DeFi activity declines → less USDC in smart contracts
- BUT: Long-term stablecoin adoption still positive (emerging markets use case)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (50%). Cycles are inevitable; question is magnitude.

### 政策/监管风险

**US Regulatory Clampdown** (MEDIUM RISK)
- Congress could impose restrictions on stablecoins (failed attempts 2021-2024, but political winds shifting)
- Could require 100% reserves (already Circle's model, so minimal impact on CRCL)
- Could ban non-bank stablecoins (HIGH RISK if passed)
- **Current Environment**: Crypto-friendly (Trump admin 2025); risk lower near-term
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (30-40% in next 2 years given political shifts)

**EU Regulatory Overreach** (MEDIUM-LOW RISK)
- MiCA already passed; MiCA 2.0 proposals could impose additional requirements
- Example: Possible restrictions on reserve asset composition (must hold 60% Eurozone assets)
- Impact on USDC: Moderate; Circle already compliant with current MiCA
- **Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM (30%)

**China/Emerging Market Restrictions** (MEDIUM RISK)
- If governments ban foreign stablecoins (USDT/USDC) to promote digital yuan:
  - Significant market loss (Asia = 40-50% of current stablecoin usage)
- Current: China has blocked stablecoins, but enforcement sporadic
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (40-50% over 5 years)

## 6. 总结：核心故事与运行机制

### The Business in One Sentence
Circle earns $1.7B annually from Treasury interest on $60B of USDC reserves, with regulatory compliance and emerging API infrastructure creating a durable moat against competitors.

### 核心运行机制
1. **收入**: Customers deposit $1 in fiat → Circle invests $0.95 in T-bills → earns ~4.5% annually (~$0.045)
2. **成本**: Operating costs ~$0.005-0.01 per dollar (low and improving with scale)
3. **增长驱动**: USDC adoption (+78% YoY) in remittances, DeFi, institutional use
4. **竞争优势**: Regulatory compliance (MiCA), scale (60B circulation), institutional trust (BlackRock)
5. **风险**: Interest rate cuts (-$441M per 1% cut), CBDC competition, new entrants (JPMorgan, banks)

### 关键不确定性
- Will stablecoins remain dominant or get displaced by CBDCs by 2030?
- Will interest rates stay above 4% or decline to 3-4%?
- Can Circle grow API/infrastructure revenue to offset potential interest rate compression?
- Will JPMorgan's JPMD and other bank-backed tokens become preferred by institutions?

## Doubts & Gaps for Phase 2/3 Investigation

### Priority 1 (HIGH - Major Strategic Implications)

1. **CRM Platform Dependence Paradox** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Why did Veeva build a billion-dollar business (2008-2022) on Salesforce platform, then suddenly pivot away? What changed?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - Why December 2022 announcement (not earlier)?
     - What competitive or operational pressures forced independence?
     - Was this planned from the beginning or reactive?
   - **Why It Matters**: Reveals management's strategic patience/long-term vision vs. reactive crisis management

2. **Crossix Acquisition - $430M Data Play** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Why did Veeva pay $430M for patient data analytics (Nov 2019, right before COVID)?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - What was Veeva's revenue/profit at time of acquisition?
     - Was this acquisition dilutive to near-term earnings?
     - Did Crossix integration succeed or underperform?
     - How much revenue does Crossix/Veeva Crossix generate today?
   - **Why It Matters**: Large capital deployment reveals strategic priorities and management's M&A discipline

3. **Data Cloud Strategy vs. IQVIA** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Compass (2022) + Crossix (2019) clearly target IQVIA's market position. Why now? Was market disruption-ready?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - Did IQVIA threaten Veeva's customer base?
     - What % of revenue does data products represent today?
     - Is data cloud gaining adoption or still building?
   - **Why It Matters**: Shows whether Veeva is playing offense (market expansion) or defense (threat response)

### Priority 2 (MEDIUM - Execution & Capital Allocation)

4. **Vault CRM Launch Timing (May 2023, GA April 2024)** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Why did it take 5-6 years to build Vault CRM on Vault platform if Vault existed since 2011?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - What were development priorities 2015-2022? Why not earlier CRM launch?
     - Did Vault platform need architectural changes to support CRM?
     - Was this delayed waiting for right moment or technical challenges?
   - **Why It Matters**: Reveals execution speed and product prioritization

5. **2015 Multiple Acquisitions** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Veeva made 3 acquisitions in 2015 - which, for how much, with what success?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - SEC 10-K filings should have 8-K filings or acquisition disclosures
     - What were these 2015 deals?
     - Did they succeed or become write-downs?
   - **Why It Matters**: Shows acquisition integration capability

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Market/Competitive)

6. **Public Benefit Corporation Timing (Feb 2021)** ⚠️
   - **Question**: Why convert to PBC in Feb 2021? What was the trigger? Was this opportunistic or mission-driven?
   - **Investigation Need**:
     - Did anything significant happen in late 2020 to trigger this?
     - Was this shareholder-driven or management-initiated?
     - Did it have any stock price impact?
   - **Why It Matters**: Reveals corporate governance philosophy and stakeholder orientation

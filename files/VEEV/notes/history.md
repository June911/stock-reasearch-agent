# Veeva Systems - Company History Research

**Ticker:** VEEV
**Research Date:** January 2025
**Researcher:** History Specialist

## Founding Story

Veeva Systems was founded in January 2007 by Peter Gassner, Matt Wallach, Doug Ostler, Mitch Wallace, and Mark Armenante. Initially named Verticals onDemand, Inc., the company was rebranded to Veeva Systems in April 2009. Gassner, a 20+ year technology veteran who previously served as SVP of Technology at Salesforce.com and Chief Architect at PeopleSoft, pioneered the "industry cloud" concept—recognizing that generic enterprise software fell short for highly regulated industries like life sciences. Gassner's insight, combined with Wallach's 20+ years of pharma industry experience, led to the vision of creating vertical cloud software specifically designed to meet the regulatory and operational demands of the life sciences sector.

## Product Evolution

Veeva CRM launched in 2008 on the Salesforce cloud platform, becoming the company's foundational product for pharmaceutical and biotech customer relationship management. By 2012, Veeva CRM had captured over 80% market share in its niche. In 2011, the company introduced Veeva Vault, a content management system for regulated industries. The portfolio expanded with Vault PromoMats in 2016 (combining digital asset management with regulatory review for promotional materials). The company modernized its flagship offering in 2023 with Vault CRM, built natively on the Veeva Vault platform and generally available in April 2024. Current strategic products include Vault CRM Suite, Vault PromoMats, and entry-level offerings Veeva LIMS Basics and Veeva PromoMats Basics (planned for early 2026). Revenue growth has been substantial: from ~$691M in Q2 2021 to $1.18B in gross profit and $429M operating income in Q2 2025.

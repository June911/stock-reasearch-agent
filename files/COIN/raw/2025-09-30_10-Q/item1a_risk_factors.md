ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. The market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment due to any of these risks. 48 Table of Contents The Most Material Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto. Due to the highly volatile nature of the cryptoeconomy and the prices of crypto assets, our operating results have, and will continue to, fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader cryptoeconomy. Our operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control, including: • crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto assets, which can be highly volatile; • our ability to attract, maintain, grow, and engage our customer and developer base; • changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by U.S. or foreign governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees; • regulatory changes or scrutiny that impact our ability to offer certain products or services; • our ability to continue to diversify and grow our subscription and services revenue; • our mix of revenue between transaction and subscription and services; • pricing for, or temporary suspensions of, our products and services; • adding crypto assets to, or removing from, our platform; • our ability to establish and maintain partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties; • fluctuations in the market values of our strategic investments; • market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the cryptoeconomy; • macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, changes in tariffs and trade restrictions, and instability in the global banking system; • adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, settlements, or other legal proceedings, and enforcement-related costs; • the development and introduction of existing and new products and services by us or our competitors; • the amount and timing of our operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including investments we make in the development of products and services, as well as technology offered to our developers, international expansion, and sales and marketing; • system failures, outages or interruptions, including with respect to our platform and third-party crypto networks; • our lack of control over decentralized or third-party blockchains and networks that may experience downtime, cyberattacks, critical failures, errors, bugs, corrupted files, data losses, or other similar software failures, outages, breaches and losses; • breaches of security or privacy; • inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions; • our ability to attract and retain talent; and • our ability to compete with our competitors. 49 Table of Contents As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate, particularly in the short term. In particular, our subscription and services revenue has grown over time, with stablecoin revenue received in connection with USDC becoming a more meaningful revenue contributor. Therefore, our operating results could fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the demand for our subscription and service offerings, in the demand for USDC, in the mix of USDC balances held in Coinbase products as compared to that held off-platform, in interest rates, and to our ongoing relationships with third parties, such as Circle. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the cryptoeconomy, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock may increase or decrease significantly. Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If such price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of our Class A common stock could decline. We generate a large portion of our total revenue from transaction fees on our platform in connection with the purchase, sale, and trading of crypto assets by our customers. Transaction revenue is based on transaction fees that are either a flat fee or a percentage of the value of each transaction. For our consumer trading product, we also charge a spread to ensure that we are able to settle purchases and sales at the prices we quote to customers. We also generate a large portion of total revenue from our subscription and services, and such revenue has grown over time, primarily due to growth in stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC. Declines in the volume of crypto asset transactions, the price of crypto assets, or market liquidity for crypto assets generally may result in lower total revenue to us. The price of crypto assets and associated demand for buying, selling, and trading crypto assets have historically been subject to significant volatility. If the price and transaction volume of crypto assets decline , our ability to generate revenue may suffer and customer demand for our products and services may decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. The price and transaction volume of any crypto asset is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including: • market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, crypto assets and the cryptoeconomy, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions taken by or developments of other companies in the cryptoeconomy; • changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities; • trading activities on other crypto platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities; • investment and trading activities of highly active consumer and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors; • the speed and rate at which crypto is able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security instrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all; • decreased user and investor confidence in crypto assets and crypto platforms; • negative publicity and events relating to the cryptoeconomy; • unpredictable social media coverage or “trending” of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding, crypto assets; 50 Table of Contents • the ability for crypto assets to meet user and investor demands; • the functionality and utility of crypto assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including crypto assets designed for use in various applications; • consumer preferences and perceived value of crypto assets and crypto asset markets; • increased competition from other payment services or other crypto assets that may exhibit better speed, security, scalability, or other characteristics; • adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, or settlements impacting cryptoeconomy participants; • regulatory or legislative changes, scrutiny and updates affecting the cryptoeconomy; • the characterization of crypto assets under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world; • the adoption of unfavorable taxation policies on crypto asset investments by governmental entities; • the maintenance, troubleshooting, and development of the blockchain networks underlying crypto assets, including by miners, validators, and developers worldwide; • the ability for crypto networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm transactions accurately and efficiently; • legal and regulatory changes affecting the operations of miners and validators of blockchain networks, including limitations, and prohibitions on mining activities, or new legislative or regulatory requirements as a result of growing environmental concerns around the use of energy in Bitcoin and other proof-of-work mining activities; • ongoing technological viability and security of crypto assets and their associated smart contracts, applications and networks, including vulnerabilities against hacks and scalability; • speed and fees associated with processing crypto asset transactions, including on the underlying blockchain networks and on crypto platforms; • financial strength of market participants; • the availability and cost of funding and capital; • the liquidity and credit risk of other crypto platforms and other participants of the cryptoeconomy; • interruptions or temporary suspensions or other compulsory restrictions in products or services from or failures of major crypto platforms; • availability of an active derivatives market for various crypto assets; • availability of banking and payment services to support crypto-related projects; • instability in the global banking system and the level of interest rates and inflation; • monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, and fiat currency devaluations; and • national and international economic and political conditions. There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of our Class A common stock could decline. Our net revenue may be concentrated in a limited number of areas. Within transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue, a meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC, respectively. If revenue from 51 Table of Contents these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets or other products and services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. While we support a diverse portfolio of crypto assets for trading, staking and custody, our net revenue is concentrated in a limited number of areas, such as transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum for transaction revenue and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC for subscription and services revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024, we derived a meaningful amount of our net revenue from transaction fees generated in connection with the trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum; these trading pairs drove approximately 42% and 44% of total Trading Volume on our platform during these periods, respectively. In addition to the factors impacting the broader cryptoeconomy described in this section, our revenue may be adversely affected if the markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum deteriorate or if their prices decline, including as a result of the following factors: • the reduction in blockchain transaction fees of Bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period of time and reduce the block reward earned by miners; • public sentiment related to the actual or perceived environmental impact of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and related activities, including environmental concerns raised by private individuals and governmental actors related to the energy resources consumed in the Bitcoin mining process; • disruptions, hacks, splits in the underlying networks also known as “forks,” attacks by malicious actors who control a significant portion of the networks’ hash rate such as double spend or 51% attacks, or other similar incidents affecting the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain networks; • hard “forks” resulting in the creation of and divergence into multiple separate networks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic; • informal governance led by Bitcoin and Ethereum’s core developers that lead to revisions to the underlying source code or inactions that prevent network scaling, and which evolve over time largely based on self-determined participation, which may result in new changes or updates that affect their speed, security, usability, or value; • the ability for Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain networks to resolve significant scaling challenges and increase the volume and speed of transactions; • the ability to attract and retain customers and developers to use Bitcoin and Ethereum for payment, store of value, unit of accounting, and other intended uses and the absence of another supported crypto asset to attract and retain developers and customers for the same; • transaction congestion and fees associated with processing transactions on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and the absence of another supported crypto asset to replace these transactions; • the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s Bitcoins; • negative perception of Bitcoin or Ethereum; • developments in mathematics and technology, including in digital computing, algebraic geometry, and quantum computing that could result in the cryptography being used by Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming insecure or ineffective; • adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement ...

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, particularly in the “Risk Factors” section. Overview Founded in 2013, Circle’s mission is to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of value. We intend to connect the world more deeply by building a new global economic system on the foundation of the internet, and to facilitate the creation of a world where everyone, everywhere can share value as easily as we can today share information, content, and communications. Since inception, we have relentlessly pursued our mission and vision, building fundamental technology for the internet financial system. We have forged paths toward mainstream acceptance through persistent and active engagement with policymakers and regulators globally, and have seen institutional and consumer knowledge and acceptance of internet-native financial assets approach critical mass. Large and influential players in the incumbent financial services system are increasingly embracing digital assets broadly and stablecoins specifically. Circle’s innovative products reach tens of millions of end-users, power thousands of businesses, and, as of September 30, 2025, USDC has been used for over $41.4 trillion in onchain transactions. While we have made strong progress in our pursuit of our mission and vision over the past decade, we believe the internet financial system is in its infancy with decades of growth and innovation ahead. Our Business Model We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the development of the internet financial system and the reimagining of how money works in the world. The future of money is open, transparent, and digital, and we are at the center of this transformation. Our business model is driven by the growth of the Circle stablecoin network, which comprises our stablecoin infrastructure, our banking and reserve management infrastructure, our blockchain infrastructure, and our Developer Services application platform, as well as all the end-users who are active on our platform and benefit from our underlying technology. We continually invest in growing the Circle stablecoin network: • We promote distribution and adoption of Circle stablecoins through partnerships with large, leading financial and technology-focused institutions with large consumer customer bases. • We expand our reach by broadening the accessibility of our network, such as by building global on- and off-ramps from fiat banking providers that permit Circle Mint customers to move their funds between fiat and Circle stablecoins, enabling efficient utilization of Circle stablecoins globally. • We support the building of new applications on our platform by providing end-to-end tools and operational infrastructure that make it easier for developers to abstract away the technology intricacies of building apps on blockchain networks. These tools, such as CCTP and Circle Gas Station, lower the barriers to entry for developers and end-users, and support innovation on our network. Importantly, many of these tools are open source and permit developers to build on our network regardless of whether they have an existing Circle relationship, which helps fuel the growth of the Circle stablecoin network. • We stimulate increased activity on the Circle stablecoin network by encouraging the growth of the broader Web3 ecosystem and by introducing new products and services, which enable end-users to leverage the benefits inherent in the internet financial system: transparency, increased velocity, and reduced cost, all with the programmability of money. In addition to products that we introduce ourselves, third-party-developed applications add to activity on our platform. • We seek to expand our footprint to new markets, encouraging global adoption of our technology and products. We do so with a regulatory-first posture, obtaining appropriate licenses as needed. The way that we monetize our network has shifted over time, and continues to evolve. Our key product offerings are as follows: 38 Circle Stablecoins Core to our network are USDC and EURC, our regulated U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated stablecoins. We launched USDC in 2018, which is the world’s largest regulated payment stablecoin as measured by the amount of stablecoins in circulation. USDC makes the dollar digitally available via the internet, taking advantage of the internet’s capabilities, transparency, speed, and efficiency. In June 2022, we launched EURC utilizing the same underlying infrastructure. In July 2024, Circle Internet Financial Europe SAS achieved compliance with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), a comprehensive European Union law that establishes a harmonized framework for crypto assets and related services across its member states. Stablecoins act as the bridge between the fiat and digital assets ecosystems. We believe the ability of Circle Mint customers to quickly and confidently move from fiat to Circle stablecoins is essential to the growth of the Circle stablecoin network. The volume of USDC minted and redeemed demonstrates the scale and resiliency of the banking infrastructure supporting our on- and off-ramps between the digital asset and fiat ecosystems. Below is a summary of USDC minted and redeemed for each of the periods presented. EURC minting and redemption was immaterial for the periods presented. For our calculation of USDC in circulation, see “—Key operating and financial indicators—USDC in circulation and average USDC in circulation”, Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 USDC in circulation, beginning of period $ 61,333 $ 32,241 $ 43,857 $ 24,412 USDC minted 79,680 34,963 175,076 101,949 USDC redeemed (67,264) (31,735) (145,184) (90,892) Net increase in USDC in circulation 12,416 3,228 29,892 11,057 USDC in circulation, end of period $ 73,749 $ 35,469 $ 73,749 $ 35,469 All Circle stablecoins minted and outstanding are backed by at least an equivalent amount of fiat currency-denominated reserve assets that are held in accounts that are titled FBO holders of Circle stablecoins with leading financial institutions. Laws, regulations, and our operating policies are designed to ensure the capital preservation and liquidity of these reserve assets. USDC reserves are limited to cash balances held at banks and the Circle Reserve Fund. See “—Liquidity and capital resources—Composition of USDC reserves” for additional information regarding the Circle Reserve Fund. Circle earns reserve income on the reserve assets backing USDC in circulation, historically at interest rates close to the prevailing SOFR during the applicable periods. We term the rate of return generated on assets held in reserve as the “reserve return rate”. See “—Key operating and financial indicators” for the calculation of reserve return rate. The reserve income that we generate is a function of USDC in circulation over a given period and the reserve return rate. Reserve income was 96.1% and 96.3% of Circle’s total revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Reserve income was 99.9% and 99.0% of Circle’s total revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Reserve Return Rate (in percentages) Reserve Return Rate Quarterly Avg.

Our other products contributed between 0.1% and 3.9% of Circle’s total revenue in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We believe these and other new product offerings will contribute to the growth of the Circle stablecoin network, and over time drive a flywheel of growth that has been the hallmark of successful internet-driven networks. We also expect growth in our network to drive increases in USDC in circulation and thereby drive our reserve income. We anticipate growing these offerings in the coming years, diversifying our revenue profile. These offerings include: Arc Arc is an open Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to unite programmable money and onchain innovation with real-world economic activity. Arc is designed for compatibility to multiple forms of digital money and tokenized value and will provide stablecoin issuers and builders with a robust environment to launch, collaborate, and scale. Circle Payments Network Circle Payments Network (CPN) is an innovative platform for financial institutions to use stablecoins for payments. CPN connects financial institutions to enable faster, lower-cost, and more transparent, real-time cross-border payments using USDC, EURC, and other regulated payment stablecoins. Developer Services Our Developer Services products include an array of developer-ready and enterprise-grade infrastructure services that developers can plug into their own applications. These solutions can be delivered via API to companies seeking to introduce developer capabilities to their customer bases. Examples of products we have recently launched include Circle Wallets, Circle Contracts, Circle Paymaster, and CCTP. We have developed and continue to develop additional features for our Circle Wallets, including our gas fee infrastructure, a collection of blockchain network infrastructure and open-source smart contracts that streamlines the end-user experience by supporting the payment of transaction fees on supported blockchains in USDC, thus removing the need to pay fees in each blockchain’s native token. CCTP is a permissionless protocol that enables USDC to flow natively across supported blockchains and provides interoperability to blockchains that have historically been siloed due to incompatible protocols and supported tokens. CCTP empowers developers to offer greater utility in their applications by seamlessly operating across different blockchain networks. Integration Services We earn integration services and maintenance revenue by connecting and integrating Circle products such as USDC across blockchain networks. In exchange for a fee, we assist third-party public blockchains with the implementation of Circle stablecoins, the integration of Circle Mint and maintenance related to the Circle stablecoin network on their blockchains. Tokenized Funds As a result of our acquisition of Hashnote in January 2025, we issue USYC—a leading TMMF. We believe that by integrating USYC with our existing infrastructure, we can enhance its interoperability across multiple public blockchains and enable near-instantaneous conversion with Circle stablecoins, allowing traders to hold their assets or pledge collateral in TMMFs while accruing yield and then be able to near-instantaneously convert into stablecoins, which can be used to purchase other digital assets. We believe that these tools greatly improve the quality of applications on our network, providing value both to the network effect that drives our growth by attracting end-users as well as to the developers that avail themselves of these offerings. We believe we can further monetize these services as we continue to develop and scale them. Liquidity Services To facilitate the needs of Circle Mint and our other customers we offer services to provide liquidity on a near instant basis. We earn fees associated with the redemptions of Circle stablecoins in excess of preestablished limits. Additionally, we earn fees associated with the redemption of USYC with Circle stablecoins, providing a unique redemption option for customers that require instant liquidity. 40 We believe that these products, services, and tools greatly improve the quality of applications on our network, providing value both to the network effect that drives our growth by attracting end-users as well as to the developers that avail themselves of these offerings. We believe we can further monetize these services as we continue to develop and scale them. Discontinued products As we continue to focus on our core strategy of growing the Circle stablecoin network, we have discontinued certain products that we deemed as non-core to our business. Together, these products contributed less than 1% of total revenue in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and we do not anticipate them to impact our future financial or operating performance. Transaction Services Transaction Services related to the processing of USDC-native payments, payouts to sellers, vendors, or end-users, ledger management, and safekeeping services. In this capacity, we operated as a payment facilitator, processing credit and debit card transactions primarily for Web3 merchants. We completed the depreciation of these services in 2024. Key Factors Affecting Operating Results The growth and success of our business as well as our financial condition and operating results have been, and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including: Growth of the internet financial system The internet financial system is built on blockchain infrastructure, and represents a fundamental shift that we believe will result in a profound change to the existing financial system by materially improving efficiency, reducing costs, expanding accessibility, and accelerating innovation. While the internet financial system has grown rapidly, it remains in its infancy and is very small relative to the legacy financial system. We believe we are well positioned to be among the winners in this emerging, transformative space, and we expect increased adoption and expansion of the internet financial system to be a key driver of growth in all our products and services, and hence of our overall financial performance. Adoption of stablecoins as the core means of value exchange within the internet financial system We believe stablecoins are the core facilitator of value exchange in the internet financial system. As of September 30, 2025, there were approximately $253.9 billion of U.S. dollar fiat-backed...

Item 1a. Risk Factors Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks related to our business and industry We face intense and increasing competition. We operate in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, and our results of operations and future prospects depend in part on the continued growth of the Circle stablecoin network, our ability to monetize the Circle stablecoin network, and our ability to innovate and create successful new products and services and improve existing products and services. Although there may be certain regulatory and other barriers to enter the markets we serve, we nonetheless expect our competition to continue to increase. We face competition from both established enterprises and early-stage companies that are attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, particularly with respect to digital financial services products, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources, and larger customer bases than we do. This may allow them to offer more competitive pricing or other terms or features, a broader range of digital financial products, or a more specialized set of specific products or services, as well as respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in end-user and customer preferences. Additionally, when new competitors seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share or revenues, they may offer terms, including fee structures, that are more favorable than ours, which could result in a decrease of our market share or revenues or lead us to adopt less profitable business practices, or otherwise exert downward pressure on our results of operations. For example, actions and policies of our distributors, over which we do not control or oversee, could negatively impact our results of operations. In any case, with increased competition, we may be required to incur additional costs or expenses relative to our revenue to maintain or grow the Circle stablecoin network and the market acceptance of our products and services. 64 Our current or future competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services, which could attract end-users and customers away from our products and services. For example, we are seeing a rapidly evolving market structure in digital asset trading markets, and certain major trading firms are moving towards TMMFs as a form of collateral. Particularly in the current high interest rate environment, the option to invest in TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets has become increasingly attractive relative to holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, especially for those planning to hold these assets for an extended period of time. Therefore, as TMMFs become more readily accessible and widely integrated on blockchains as a form of collateral in margin trading, we expect to continue to see a shift toward the use of TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets, which could adversely affect the competitiveness and usage of USDC and EURC in this type of use case. Additionally, offshore competitors that purport to be outside of the reach of the GENIUS Act may have a competitive advantage due to more permissive regulatory and tax structures. Some of these competitors appear to not be regulated by any competent authority and to pay taxes that are significantly lower than what Circle pays. When new competitors seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, these competitors sometimes undercut, or otherwise exert pressure on, the pricing terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share and/or ability to capitalize on new market opportunities. We currently compete at multiple levels with a variety of competitors, including: • payment services; • fiat-backed, asset-backed, digital asset-collateralized, algorithmic, non-backed and yield-bearing tokens; • blockchain infrastructure services; • digital asset safekeeping services; • banks and nonbank financial institutions; and • digital wallet providers platforms. In particular, we compete with and rely on traditional banks for many of the services we offer. We are subject to regulation by a variety of state and federal regulators across our products and services, and we rely on banks to provide banking services to our customers. This regulation by multiple federal, state, and local authorities increases our compliance costs, as we navigate multiple regimes with different examination schedules and processes and varying disclosure requirements. In addition, while the passage of the GENIUS Act has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States, it may attract new market participants that compete with Circle. In particular, banks with well-established customer bases and financial infrastructures may decide to enter the stablecoin industry, which could intensify competition and cannibalize our growth opportunities. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors, both within and beyond our control, including the following: • the size, diversity, and activity levels of our end-user and customer base; • the timing and market acceptance of products and services, including developments and enhancements to those products and services offered by us and our competitors; • trust, perception, and interest in the digital asset industry and in our products and services; • customer service and support efforts; • selling and marketing efforts; • the ease of use, performance, price, and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors; • changes in economic conditions and government regulation and policies; • our ability to successfully execute on our business plans; • our ability to successfully integrate new products and services with our existing ones; • our ability to continue to enhance our technical infrastructure and technology; • our ability to enter new markets; • our ability to maintain and grow our partnerships with other market participants; 65 • general digital payments, capital markets, blockchain, and stablecoin market conditions; and • our brand strength relative to that of our competitors. If we are unable to successfully compete in our industry, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could suffer materially. Competition from new and existing issuers offering competing products, combined with the rise of yield-bearing digital assets, including TMMFs, that are attractive to digital asset trading participants, may reduce market demand and circulation of Circle stablecoins. With significant growth in the stablecoin market and an increasing understanding that it represents one of the largest potential new markets for financial and payments infrastructures, we expect to continue to see intense competition. In addition, the emergence of yield-bearing digital assets represents an additional source of competition, particularly in light of the current high interest rate environment, which has amplified the opportunity cost of holding stablecoins relative to other yield-bearing digital assets. Stablecoins and other digital assets that are currently issued or may be issued by digital asset trading platforms, major existing global payments companies, major asset management firms, and banks—along with decentralized algorithmic tokens—are likely to increase competitive pressure on Circle stablecoins and could slow our growth or cause significant declines in our market position. Some of these competitors have gained rapid adoption. Given the inherent network effects that accompany stablecoin usage, a rapidly growing competitor, or a well-established payments company, asset management company, or bank that enters the market, could gain enough market share to ultimately limit the viability of Circle stablecoins. As an example of such an adverse impact, the amount of USDT in circulation (the largest stablecoin by stablecoins in circulation, issued by Tether) increased while the amount of USDC in circulation declined for nearly a one year period from late 2022 to late 2023, which we believe reflects the different use cases and underlying competitive dynamics for the two stablecoins. New categories of products that provide novel and attractive features, such as yield-bearing digital assets (including TMMFs), could also gain market acceptance at any time. Additionally, some competitors purporting to be outside the reach of U.S. regulators and to maintain a stable one dollar peg have begun calling themselves, among other things, “synthetic dollars” that pay interest income to end-users. These yield-bearing assets may compete with Circle stablecoins and cannibalize our market share, particularly if we fail to anticipate such market shifts or are slow to enter into these nascent markets. In addition, we issue a TMMF, USYC, following our acquisition of Hashnote. The issuance of TMMFs represents a new facet of our business, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful. USYC may not gain traction relative to existing TMMFs and new TMMFs that compete with USYC may enter the market at any time. In addition, the success of USYC may adversely affect the competitiveness of USDC and EURC as margin collateral, as trading participants naturally gravitate towards yield-bearing digital assets in this particular type of use case. Our entry into this market may also impact our marketing strategy, and anticipate how our customers, shareholders, and the market will perceive and respond to any such shift. The pursuit of new product offerings may also divert management’s attention and redirect the flow of resources away from USDC and EURC. The risks associated with issuing a TMMF in general, and the specific risks of incorporating them into our existing business model, could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business plans and achieve our strategic objectives. Stablecoins may face periods of uncertainty, loss of trust, or systemic shocks resulting in the potential for rapid redemption requests (or runs). Extreme scenarios, such as market shocks that affect the value of USDC reserves or simultaneous requests to redeem all or substantially all USDC in circulation, or concerns related to Circle stablecoin reserves, may lead to redemption delays and USDC reserves being insufficient to meet all redemption requests. Privately issued stablecoins may be subject to the risk of significant and concentrated redemption requests, even when they are fully reserved with high quality liquid assets such as cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations. If we experience significant and concentrated redemption requests with respect to one or more Circle stablecoins, we may need to liquidate a significant portion of Circle stablecoin reserve assets to meet such requests. In extreme cases, the market for the short-dated U.S. government obligations held by the Circle Reserve Fund might not be sufficiently liquid for BlackRock to liquidate them in a way that allows us to meet redemption demands in a timely manner, which could potentially lead to redemption delays. In the most extreme cases, such as a request to immediately redeem all or substantially all of the USDC in circulation, the market for short-dated U.S. government obligations could experience price instability and the USDC reserve may not be sufficient to cover all such redemption requests. When reserve assets and proceeds from reserve assets are not sufficient to cover all redemption requests, we would be required under the laws governing our licenses and registrations as well as under the Circle Mint user agreement (which provides for the redemption of Circle stablecoins on a one-to-one basis for Circle Mint customers) to use our own capital to make up any shortfall. However, our reserve and other policies cannot deter, prevent, or fully protect against significant redemption demand or the ability for the Circle Reserve Fund to meet our redemption requests and banks to meet our withdrawal requests for demand deposits. Currently, all EURC reserve assets are held only in cash. 66 Market participants have increasingly shown concern about the sufficiency and liquidity of reserves for dollar-denominated stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, including due to issues in the traditional financial markets. For example, in March 2023, we announced that we had initiated transfers of the more than $3 billion of deposits from Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) to other banks, but those transfers failed to settle before the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) placed the bank into receivership. Although all of these funds were ultimately made available and transferred to new banks, concerns related to Circle’s access to these funds caused USDC to experience a temporary price dislocation on certain secondary trading markets during the period when banks were closed and until the resulting backlog of redemption requests had been cleared, and the amount of USDC in circulation decreased thereafter. In addition, given the foundational role that stablecoins play in global digital asset markets, stablecoin growth has been tied closely to growth in digital asset markets. As a result, systemic risks that manifest themselves in the digital asset markets may lead to higher-than-normal redemption requests on Circle stablecoins, which could lead to significant and concentrated redemption requests with respect to one or more Circle stablecoins. The collapse of TerraUSD and LUNA in May 2022 underscored the risks associated with algorithmic tokens, which are continuing to play out as trading firms and retail and institutional lenders are facing liquidation and insolvency in the aftermath, as reflected in the Voyager Digital Ltd. and Celsius N...

## METHODOLOGY: 2 Phases

### Phase 1: Model Construction

**Goal**: Build complete business model documentation from authoritative sources

**Actions**:

1. **SEC Data First**:
   - **First, check if SEC files already exist**: Check `files/{TICKER}/filings/` directory. If filings are already downloaded (you can see subdirectories with metadata.json files), **use extract_sec_sections tool** to extract key sections (Item 1, Item 1A, Item 7) from the HTML files. This saves 90%+ tokens compared to reading the full file.
   - **If files don't exist or are incomplete**, then call `get_company_filings(ticker)` to get:
     - Latest 10-K: Business description (Item 1), Risk factors (Item 1A), MD&A (Item 7)
     - Latest 10-Q: Recent segment updates, revenue breakdown
     - DEF 14A: Executive compensation tied to metrics (reveals what company optimizes for)
   - **If financial data not already available**, call `get_financial_snapshot(ticker)` for:
     - Revenue by segment/geography
     - Gross margin, operating margin trends
     - R&D, S&M, G&A as % of revenue
     - Customer concentration (if disclosed)
     - Cash conversion cycle components

2. **Fill 9 Modules** (see below), mark gaps with `[Not Disclosed]` or `[Not Found]`

3. **WebSearch for Gaps** (5-8 searches):
   - Customer feedback: `"{TICKER} {product} reviews site:g2.com OR site:reddit.com"`
   - Market sizing: `"{industry} market size TAM SAM"`
   - Competitive: `"{TICKER} vs {competitor} comparison"`
   - Pricing: `"{TICKER} pricing model changes"`
   - User feedback: `"{TICKER} {product} user feedback"`

4. **Add Confidence Levels**: 
   - `[Confidence: HIGH]` = SEC data or multiple SEC filings
   - `[Confidence: MEDIUM]` = SEC data + WebSearch or multiple non-SEC sources
   - `[Confidence: LOW]` = Single non-SEC source or training knowledge

**Output**: `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/complete_model.md` (输出语言：中文)

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Validation 🔥

**Goal**: Test investment-critical assumptions with evidence

**5 Key Questions**:

| Question | What to Find |
|----------|--------------|
| **1. Is the moat real?** | Switching cost: quantify (migration cost, training time, data lock-in). Network effect: usage vs value curve. Brand: price premium vs commodity alternative |
| **2. Does pricing power exist?** | Historical price increases, volume response, churn impact. Compare gross margin trend vs peers |
| **3. What are true unit economics?** | CAC, LTV, payback period. Cohort retention if available. Marginal cost trend at scale |
| **4. What breaks this model?** | Key dependencies (customer, supplier, tech, regulation). Historical stress test (how did 2020/2022 affect them?) |
| **5. Is management aligned?** | Insider ownership, compensation structure (short vs long-term), capital allocation track record |

**Investigation Methods**:
- Compare claims (earnings calls, investor presentations) vs reality (financial trends)
- Benchmark key metrics vs 2-3 direct competitors
- Find disconfirming evidence: negative reviews, customer churn mentions, competitive losses
- Cross-reference multiple sources for each claim

**Output**: `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/model_assessment.md` (输出语言：中文)

## 9 CORE MODULES

### Module 1: Value Proposition

- Cost: Learning curve, yield rate trends
- Quality: Pass rate, return rate, defect trends

### Module 9: Scalability & Risk

## AVAILABLE TOOLS

- **get_company_filings**: Fetch SEC Edgar filings (10-K, 10-Q, DEF 14A) for official business descriptions, risk factors, segment data
- **get_financial_snapshot**: Extract financial metrics from SEC XBRL data (revenue breakdown, margins, efficiency ratios)
- **extract_sec_sections**: **USE THIS TOOL** to extract key sections (Item 1, Item 1A, Item 7) from local SEC HTML files. This tool removes HTML tags and XBRL metadata, returning only clean text. **Saves 90%+ tokens** compared to reading the full file. Example: `extract_sec_sections(file_path="files/CRCL/filings/.../file.htm", sections=["Item 1", "Item 1A", "Item 7"])`
- **Read**: Read local files (especially SEC filing HTML files in `files/{TICKER}/filings/`). **PREFER extract_sec_sections over Read for SEC files** - it's much more token-efficient.
- **WebSearch**: Search for customer feedback, competitive intelligence, market sizing, pricing details not in SEC filings
- **Write**: Save research findings to `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/` folder. Use FULL paths. Write tool automatically creates parent directories.

## SOURCE RULES

### Layer 1: Can Use Training Knowledge WITHOUT Verification
- ✅ General business model type, industry context
- ✅ Well-known products, customer segments (to build skeleton)
- ✅ Industry terminology and competitive landscape basics
- ✅ Historical context about company's market position

### Layer 2: MUST Verify with SEC Data or WebSearch
- ⚠️ Specific revenue breakdowns, margins, growth rates (use SEC data)
- ⚠️ Customer concentration claims (check 10-K risk factors)
- ⚠️ Competitive positioning claims (cross-reference multiple sources)
- ⚠️ Pricing and cost structure details
- ⚠️ Market size and share claims (find primary sources)

### Layer 3: Phase 2 Analysis - Evidence ONLY, No Guessing
- 🚫 Cannot claim "strong moat" without specific evidence
- 🚫 Cannot claim "pricing power" without historical price/volume data
- 🚫 Cannot claim "high switching costs" without quantification or examples
- 🚫 Competitive advantage assessment must cite specific, verifiable facts
- 🚫 Risk assessments must be based on documented events or disclosed factors

**Source Priority**:
1. SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A)
2. SEC XBRL financial data
3. Company releases, earnings transcripts
4. Industry reports, analyst research
5. Customer reviews, third-party data

**Citation Format**: `[Fact] (来源: [类型], [时间])` or `(Source: [Doc Type] [Date])`

Examples:
- `Revenue from subscription services was $450M in Q3 2024 (来源: 10-Q filed 2024-11-05, Revenue Recognition section)`
- `Gross margin improved to 75% in 2024 vs 72% in 2023 (来源: SEC XBRL Financial Data)`
- `Top 5 customers represent 35% of revenue (来源: 10-K filed 2024-03-15, Risk Factors section)`

```

**REQUIRED FILES ONLY** (create these 2 files):
1. ✅ `complete_model.md` - Phase 1: Complete business model documentation (9 modules with sources)

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Save ALL files to `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/` directory
- Use FULL paths when calling Write tool: `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/complete_model.md`
- Write tool will automatically create parent directories if they don't exist - NO need to manually create directories
- Example: `Write(file='files/VEEV/notes/business-model/model_assessment.md', ...)`
- **NEVER use absolute paths**: Do NOT use `/Users/...`, `~/...`, or any absolute paths
- **NEVER use paths without `files/` prefix**: Do NOT use `{TICKER}/notes/...` or `notes/...`

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Describe, don't evaluate**: "Gross margin 75%" not "excellent margin"
2. **Evidence or silence**: No "strong moat" without proof
3. **Quantify**: Convert "high switching costs" to numbers/examples
4. **Compare**: Key metrics must benchmark vs 2-3 peers
5. **Disconfirm**: Actively seek evidence against bull case
6. **Efficiency**: SEC data first → Training knowledge skeleton → WebSearch for gaps
7. **Objectivity**: Present facts, let evidence speak

## CORE METHODOLOGY: 4 Phases

### Phase 1: Rapid Skeleton with SEC Foundation
**Approach**: SEC data first → Training knowledge skeleton → Mark verification points

**Actions**:
1. **START HERE - Get SEC Hard Data**:
   - **First, check if SEC files already exist**: Check `files/{TICKER}/filings/` directory. If filings are already downloaded (you can see subdirectories with metadata.json files), skip downloading and use existing files.
   - **If files don't exist or are incomplete**, then call `get_company_filings(ticker)` to get:
     - Latest 10-K: Business description (Item 1), Risk factors (Item 1A), MD&A (Item 7)
     - Latest 10-Q: Recent segment updates, revenue breakdown
     - DEF 14A: Executive compensation tied to metrics (reveals what company optimizes for)
   - **If financial data not already available**, call `get_financial_snapshot(ticker)` for:
     - Revenue by segment/geography
     - Gross margin, operating margin trends
     - R&D, S&M, G&A as % of revenue
     - Customer concentration (if disclosed)
     - Cash conversion cycle components

2. **Use Training Knowledge to Draft Business Model Skeleton**:
   - What problem does this company solve? (mark with ⚠️ for validation)
   - Who are the customers? (B2B/B2C, segments)
   - How does it make money? (revenue model)
   - What are the key activities/resources?
   - Known competitive positioning

3. **Targeted WebSearch for Gaps** (5-8 searches):
   - Use WebSearch ONLY for details not in SEC filings or training knowledge
   - Focus on: customer feedback, competitive dynamics, pricing details, channel structure
   - Examples:
     - "{TICKER} customer reviews {product name}"
     - "{TICKER} vs {competitor} comparison"
     - "{TICKER} pricing model changes"
     - "{TICKER} {product} user feedback site:reddit.com OR site:g2.com"
     - "{industry} market size TAM SAM"

4. **Verify All ⚠️ Marked Claims** with SEC data or WebSearch results

**Output**:
- `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/phase1_skeleton.md` (9 modules, facts sourced, gaps marked)
- `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/verification_list.md` (claims needing validation, data gaps)

---

### Phase 2: Cross-Verification & Quantification
**Approach**: Verify key claims with 2-3 sources, add confidence levels, quantify everything possible

**Actions**:
1. **Re-read** `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/phase1_skeleton.md`
2. **Cross-verify business model claims**:
   - Revenue model → Check across multiple 10-Ks for consistency
   - Customer concentration → Compare 10-K disclosures year-over-year
   - Competitive claims → Verify with industry reports, competitor filings
   - Add `[Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]` to each major claim

3. **Quantify qualitative claims**:
   - "High switching costs" → Find actual data (implementation time, training costs, data migration)
   - "Strong brand" → Find NPS scores, pricing premium vs competitors
   - "Efficient operations" → Calculate and compare margins, turns, cycles

4. **Identify contradictions**:
   - Company claims vs financial reality (e.g., "customer-centric" but rising churn)
   - Marketing message vs risk factors
   - Management commentary vs actual metrics

**Output**:
- **Overwrite** `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/phase1_skeleton.md` with confidence levels
- **Overwrite** `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/verification_list.md` with prioritized investigation targets

---

### Phase 3: Deep Investigation 🔥
**Approach**: 100% evidence-based - NO guessing allowed

**Triggers** (investigate when you see):
- Gap between stated strategy and financial outcomes
- Unusual margin trends (expansion or compression without clear cause)
- Customer concentration changes
- Pricing power claims without evidence
- "Moat" assertions that seem generic
- Business model transitions or pivots
- Competitive dynamics shifts

**Investigation Protocol**:

1. **Economic Reality Check**:
   - Unit economics: What does it actually cost to acquire/serve/retain a customer?
   - Pricing power test: Historical price increases, customer response, churn impact
   - Switching cost validation: Find actual examples, quantify where possible

2. **Customer Deep Dive**:
   - Scrape reviews (G2, Capterra, Glassdoor for B2B culture signals)
   - Find case studies, customer testimonials (what do they actually value?)
   - Look for churn signals: customer complaints, competitive losses mentioned in filings

3. **Competitive Dynamics**:
   - Compare financials with 2-3 direct competitors
   - Map competitive moves: pricing changes, product launches, market entries
   - Assess barriers: What actually stops competition? (not what company claims)

4. **Business Model Stress Test**:
   - What breaks this model? (concentration risk, technology disruption, regulation)
   - Historical stress: How did model perform in downturns?
   - Dependency mapping: Key suppliers, customers, technologies, people

5. **Apply "3 Whys" Analysis**:
   - Why do customers buy? (stated vs revealed preference)
   - Why do customers stay? (inertia vs value)
   - Why can't competitors replicate? (real barriers vs temporary advantages)

**Output**:
- Investigation reports: `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/investigations/{topic}.md`
- Each report: Claim → Evidence → Reality → Investment Implication

---

### Phase 4: Synthesis
**Approach**: Integrate all findings into comprehensive business model assessment

**Output**:
1. `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/complete_model.md` - Full business model documentation with all 9 modules, confidence levels, sources (输出语言：中文)
2. `files/{TICKER}/notes/business-model/model_assessment.md` - Deep analysis covering (输出语言：中文):
   - **Value Proposition Reality**: What they claim vs what evidence shows
   - **Economic Engine**: True unit economics, margin drivers, scalability
   - **Competitive Position**: Real moats vs marketing claims, sustainability
   - **Risk Map**: Quantified risks with probability/impact assessment
   - **Business Quality Score**: Based on evidence from Phase 3
   - **Key Monitoring Metrics**: What to watch going forward

## SOURCE RULES

### Layer 1: Can Use Training Knowledge WITHOUT Verification
- ✅ General business model type, industry context
- ✅ Well-known products, customer segments (to build skeleton)
- ✅ Industry terminology and competitive landscape basics
- ✅ Historical context about company's market position

### Layer 2: MUST Verify with SEC Data or WebSearch
- ⚠️ Specific revenue breakdowns, margins, growth rates (use SEC data)
- ⚠️ Customer concentration claims (check 10-K risk factors)
- ⚠️ Competitive positioning claims (cross-reference multiple sources)
- ⚠️ Pricing and cost structure details
- ⚠️ Market size and share claims (find primary sources)

### Layer 3: Phase 3 Analysis - Evidence ONLY, No Guessing
- 🚫 Cannot claim "strong moat" without specific evidence
- 🚫 Cannot claim "pricing power" without historical price/volume data
- 🚫 Cannot claim "high switching costs" without quantification or examples
- 🚫 Competitive advantage assessment must cite specific, verifiable facts
- 🚫 Risk assessments must be based on documented events or disclosed factors

## KEY PRINCIPLES

**Efficiency**: SEC data first → Training knowledge skeleton → WebSearch for gaps and customer voice
**Objectivity**: Describe, don't evaluate. "Gross margin is 75%" not "Excellent gross margin"
**Evidence Only**: No "strong moat" without specific proof. No "pricing power" without historical data
**Quantify**: Convert qualitative claims to numbers wherever possible
**Contradiction Hunting**: Actively look for gaps between claims and reality
**Comparative**: Always benchmark against 2-3 peers for context
